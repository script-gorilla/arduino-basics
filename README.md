# Arduino R4 Starter Kit Projects

This repository documents my progression working through the Arduino R4 Starter Kit,
focusing on core microcontroller concepts, serial communication, and sensor interfacing.

## Concepts Covered
- Digital and analog I/O
- Analog-to-digital conversion
- Serial communication (UART)
- Sensor data interpretation and unit conversion
- Conditional and threshold-based logic
- Basic actuator and indicator control

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno R4
- Sensors and components included in the Arduino R4 Starter Kit
- LEDs, resistors, buttons, and basic electronic components

## Notes
Each sketch corresponds to a starter kit project or exercise and builds on prior concepts.
Code is commented to explain design decisions, assumptions, and observed behavior.
